A code breaker game for Android using Netbeans plugin codename one.

I wanted a quick and easy user interface for a code breaking game I made in Android.  Codename One let me set something up very easily.

'X' is displayed for a character that is the right character in the right spot.  'O' is displayed for a character guessed right, but not in the right spot.  '.' is displayed for a character that is not in the code.

This video shows a game being played.
